Callback hell is a situation that arises in asynchronous programming when multiple nested callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations.
This can lead to deeply nested and hard-to-read code, making it challenging to maintain and understand.
To solve callback hell, there are several approaches:

1. Keep your code shallow
2. Modularize
3. Handle every single error
4. Use a library
5. Use async functions (async/await)
6. Use a linter
7. Use Promises
8. Use generators

Some of the above approaches are discussed below:

- using async/await:
  async/await is a new way to write asynchronous code. It is built on top of promises, and it can be used with any promise-enabled library or with ones that return promises.

Code:

```
function delay(ms) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

async function steps() {
  await delay(1000);
  console.log('Step One');

  await delay(1000);
  console.log('Step Two');

  await delay(1000);
  console.log('Step Three');
}

// Usage
steps();
```

- Using Promises:
  Promises provide a more structured way to handle asynchronous operations, avoiding callback hell by using .then() for chaining.

Code:

```
function stepOne() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Step One');
      resolve();
    }, 1000);
  });
}

function stepTwo() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Step Two');
      resolve();
    }, 1000);
  });
}

function stepThree() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Step Three');
      resolve();
    }, 1000);
  });
}

// Usage
stepOne()
  .then(stepTwo)
  .then(stepThree);

```
